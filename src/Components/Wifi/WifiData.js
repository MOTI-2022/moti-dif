As a digital navigator, you will provide individual assistance regarding digital connectivity services information, devices, and foundational digital skills. You will connect participants to relevant and available digital resources and help resolve any emerging problems that people might face. Digital Navigators are needed now more than ever to help our San José community access digital information and services online. Please consider volunteering your time! If you are interested in being a Digital Navigator, please contact our grantee and partner organizations for any volunteer opportunities!    ",
