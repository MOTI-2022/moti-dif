      `
      No, you don’ t need to turn back your chromebook exactly to the branch from which you borrow it. You can send it back to any branch that is close to you, as long as the device is well maintained. 

      Please DO NOT return your Chromebook in the book drop. This might make your laptop missing and you have to pay additional fine for it. Please make sure you return it to our staff in any SJPL branch.`,
